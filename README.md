### Gameplay:
##### You can move blocks left right and down with the corresponding arrow or **WSAD** keys.  Spinning pieces is done with the up arrow or **W** key.  Blocks can also be moved all the way down by pressing the Space Bar. The blocks will speed up as more lines are cleared.

### Known Bugs:
* Spinning blocks can end up inside walls or other blocks
* The line clearing sometimes won't clear the correct blocks
